This is the PC code for the rover library.

To build the library, use:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


The library will be built and packaged into an archive
called blodwen.tgz (in this directory, not the build directory).

This archive will contain the libblodwen.a static library and all
the required include files.
